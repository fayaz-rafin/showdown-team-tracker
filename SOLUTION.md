# Solution: Making MCP Work in Next.js

## The Problem

The API routes return 501 because MCP tools aren't available in Next.js runtime. The routes are structured correctly but need to actually call the MCP tools.

## The Solution

Since MCP tools are available to the AI assistant (me), here's how to make it work:

### Option 1: Direct Implementation (Recommended)

I can implement the routes to actually call the MCP tools. Since I have access to them, I'll update the routes to make the calls directly.

### Option 2: Ask AI to Make Calls

When you paste a team, ask me: "Please create this team in Notion using MCP" and I'll make the call directly.

### Option 3: Implement Now

I can implement the routes right now to actually work. Let me do that.

## Next Step

I'll implement the routes to actually call the MCP tools. This will make everything work!
